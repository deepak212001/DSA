--------TIME COMPLEXITY--------
    The rate at which the time, required to run a code, changes with respect to the input size, is considered the time complexity. 
    Basically, the time complexity of a particular code depends on the given input size, not on the machine used to run the code.

    Time complexity does not refer to the time taken by the machine to execute a particular code. 
    means tc machine pe depend nhi hota hai 


    To represent the time complexity, we generally use the Big O notation
        O()
    
    TC to be computed in terms of worst case


    if(marks<25) cout<<"grade D";
    else if(marks<50) cout<<"grade c";
    else if(marks<75) cout<<"grade B";
    else   cout<<"grade A";

    if marks is less than 25  then BEST CASE  bcz first check me hi mil gya 
    if mark is greater than 25 and less than 75  then AVERAGE CASE
    if mars is more the 75 the WROST CASE bcz use sab check kar ke jana hai 

-------SPACE COMPLEXITY-----
    auxiliray space + input space 
    auxiliray space - means space that you take to solve the problems
    input  space - menas sapce that you take to store the input 
     a=2 b=1 sor a and b is input space 
     c=a+b so c is the auxilirary space

---- TIME COMPLEXITY ------
 amount of time taken by an algo to run as a function of lenth of input 
    




----- WHY TI STUDY TC AND SC

    -good computer engineer always thinks about the complexity of the code written by him 
    - resources are limited
    - measure algo to make efficient programs
    - asked by interviewer after every solution you give




-------- SPACE COMPLEXITY--------
    amount of space taken by an algo to run as a function of length of input

---UNIT TO REPRESENT COMPLEXITY----
    I. Big O: Upper bound 
    ii. Theta θ : average case
    iii. Omega Ω : Lower bound

BIG O : COMPLEXITIES
    i. contant time : O(1)
    ii. linear time : O(n)
    iii. Logarithmic time : O(logn)
    iv. Quadratic Time : O(n^2)
    v. Cubic time : O(n^3)


  Least comlexity -->  O(1),O(LOGn),O(sqrt(n)),O(n),O(nlogn),O(n^2),O(n^3),O(2^n),O(n!),O(n^n) --> most complexity
