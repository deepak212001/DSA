/*

in this pattern mostly we use two nested loop 
which is first loop is reponsible for no for row 
and nested loop which responsible for column


1.We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop,
 we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.

2. Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow
 connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get 
 the required number of columns to be printed.

3. We print the ‘*’ inside the inner loop.

4. Observe symmetry in the pattern or check if a pattern is a combination 
of two or more similar patterns.
